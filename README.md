# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
The purpose of this task was to leverage Server Side APIs to access data and display them on the page. It was also to practice handling different user events and still make API calls without error. The application is a weather dashboard. The user can search for cities and get corresponding data back. Their most recent searches get stored and are available to search again.
